<h1>The Socratique API!</h1>

<p>The Socratique API is designed to give us a simplfied server to send our functionality requests to, so we can offload the logic from the browser \n</p>
<p>Socratique is an E-Learning Platform that allows for engagement and understanding for students accross a wide spectrum of abilities \n</p>
<p>The Node.JS server is hosted on Heroku with a predefined URL configured in our private environment</p>

<p>Public Release access may be coming soon ;)</p>
